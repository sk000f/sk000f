## :office: Work

I'm an experienced software engineer, architect and tech leader working as a hands-on Head of Technology in fintech and building my own solopreneur businesses.

## :black_nib: Writing

I enjoy sharing my knowledge and experience on [my website](https://skoof.co.uk) where I also share my talks and podcast appearances.

## :computer: Open Source

I'm currently building mostly with TypeScript and am keen to contribute to more projects.

Particularly passionate about AI, DevOps and SRE, so also interested in anything around Automation, CI/CD, Chaos Engineering and Observability.
